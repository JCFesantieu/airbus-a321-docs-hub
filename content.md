Introduction
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Purpose
1.
General
The A321 AIRCRAFT CHARACTERISTICS – AIRPORT AND MAINTENANCE PLANNING
(AC) manual is issued for A321-100 and A321-200 series aircraft equipped with wing-tip fences
or sharklets, to provide necessary data to airport operators, airlines and Maintenance/Repair
Organizations (MRO) for airport and maintenance facilities planning.
 
The A320 family is the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft. An A320 takes off or lands
somewhere in the world every 1.5 seconds of every day, the family has recorded more than 117
million cycles since entry-into-service and records a best-in-class dispatch reliability of 99.7%.
 
The new engine option together with the large wingtip devices (sharklets) and a very innovative
cabin, A321neo is the most cost-efficient aircraft ever. In its maximum seating capacity,
A321neo can accommodates up to 244 passengers and shows the lowest seat mile cost on the
single-aisle aircraft market.
A321neo has three versions:
-  A321neo
-  A321LR
-  A321XLR.
A321neo is perfectly suited to fit into very competitive markets with a maximum passenger range
of 3 400 nm (6 297 km) in a high-density layout.
A321LR flies up to 4 000 nm (7 408 km) with 206 passengers because of the installation of
Additional Centre Tanks (ACTs). Ideally suited to fly transatlantic routes, A321LR allows the
airlines to go into new long-haul markets that were not accessed before with the available single-
aisle aircraft. Operators can make the cabin in a single-class layout or in a state of the art two
class configuration which includes full-flat seats for a true long-haul comfort.
A321XLR extends the range up to 4 700 nm (8 705 km) with an increased maximum takeoff
weight of 101 tons. A321XLR has a permanent Rear Centre Tank (RCT) (carrying 12900 l (3408
US gal) of fuel) and an optional forward ACT.
Unbeatable in fuel efficiency, A321neo offers outstanding environmental performance with 20%
lower fuel burn per seat and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. It also contributes to a 50% of
noise reduction compared to A321ceo.

Design Weight Terminology
-  Maximum Design Ramp Weight (MRW):
Maximum weight for ground maneuver (including weight of taxi and run-up fuel) as limited
by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements. It is also called Maximum Design Taxi
Weight (MTW).
-  Maximum Design Landing Weight (MLW):
Maximum weight for landing as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements.
-  Maximum Design Takeoff Weight (MTOW):
Maximum weight for takeoff as limited by aircraft strength and airworthiness requirements.
(This is the maximum weight at start of the take-off run).
-  Maximum Design Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW):
Maximum permissible weight of the aircraft without usable fuel.
-  Maximum Seating Capacity:
Maximum number of passengers specifically certified or anticipated for certification.
-  Usable Volume:
Usable volume available for cargo, pressurized fuselage, passenger compartment and

This section provides the height of various points of the aircraft, above the ground, for different
aircraft configurations.
Dimensions in the tables are approximate and will vary with tire type, weight and balance and
other special conditions.
The dimensions are given for:
-  A light weight, for an A/C in maintenance configuration with a mid CG,
-  An aircraft at Maximum Ramp Weight with a FWD CG and an AFT CG,
-  Aircraft on jacks, FDL at 4.60 m (15.09 ft).
NOTE :
Passenger and cargo door ground clearances are measured from the center of the
door sill and from floor level.

Landing Gear
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Landing Gear
1.
General
 
The landing gear is of the conventional retractable tricycle type comprising:
-  Two main gears with twin-wheel,
-  A twin-wheel nose gear.
 
The main landing gears are located under the wing and retract sideways towards the fuselage
centerline.
The nose landing gear retracts forward into a fuselage compartment located between FR9 and
FR20.
 
The landing gears and landing gear doors are operated and controlled electrically and
hydraulically.
In abnormal operation, the landing gear can be extended by gravity.
 
For landing gear footprint and tire size, refer to 07-02-00.
2.
Main Landing Gear
A. 
Twin-Wheel
 
Each of the two main landing gear assemblies consists of a conventional two-wheel direct
type with an integral shock absorber supported in the fore and aft directions by a fixed drag
strut and laterally by a folding strut mechanically locked when in the DOWN position.
3.
Nose Landing Gear
 
The nose landing gear consists of a leg with a built-in shock absorber strut, carrying twin wheels
with adequate shimmy damping and a folding strut mechanically locked when in the DOWN
position.
4.
Nose Wheel Steering
 



---

<a name="page-114"></a>
## Page 114

Steering is controlled by two hand wheels in the cockpit. For steering angle controlled by the
hand wheels, refer to AMM 32-51-00.
For steering angle limitation, refer to AMM 09-10-00.
 
A steering disconnection box is installed on the nose landing gear to allow steering deactivation
for towing purposes.
5.
Landing Gear Servicing Points
A. 
General
 
Filling of the landing-gear shock absorbers is done through MIL-PRF-6164 standard valves.
 
Charging of the landing-gear shock absorbers is accomplished with nitrogen through MIL-
PRF-6164 standard valves.
B. 
Charging Pressure
 
For charging of the landing-gear shock absorbers, refer to AMM 12-14-32.
6.
Braking
A. 
General
 
The four main wheels are equipped with carbon multidisc brakes.
 
The braking system is electrically controlled and hydraulically operated.
 
The braking system has four braking modes plus autobrake and anti-skid systems:
-  Normal braking with anti-skid capability,
-  Alternative braking with anti-skid capability,
-  Alternative braking without anti-skid capability,
-  Parking brake with full pressure application capability only.
B. 
In-Flight Wheel Braking
 
The main gear wheels are braked automatically before the wheels enter the wheel bay.
 
The nose gear wheels are stopped by the wheels contacting a rubbing strip (the brake
band) when the gear is in the retracted position.

Landing Gear Maintenance Pits
1.
Description
 
The minimum maintenance pit envelopes for the landing-gear shock absorber removal are
shown in FIGURE 2-9-0-991-026-A and FIGURE 2-9-0-991-027-A.
 
All dimensions shown are minimum dimensions with zero clearances.
 
The dimensions for the pits have been determined as follows:
-  The length and width of the pits allow the gear to rotate as the weight is taken off the landing
gear.
-  The depth of the pits allows the shock absorber to be removed when all the weight is taken
off the landing gear.
 
Dimensions for elevators and associated mechanisms must be added to those in FIGURE 2-9-0-
991-026-A and FIGURE 2-9-0-991-027-A.

Engine and Nacelle
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200
1.
Engine and Nacelle - CFM Engine
A. 
Engine
 
The engine is a dual-rotor, variable stator, high bypass ratio turbofan powerplant for
subsonic services. The principal modules of the engine are:
-  low pressure compressor (fan stator and fan rotor)
-  high pressure compressor
-  turbine frame
-  combustion chamber
-  high pressure turbine
-  low pressure turbine
-  accessory drives (gear box).
 
The 9 stage high pressure compressor is driven by 1 stage high pressure turbine, and
the integrated front fan and booster is driven by 4 stage low pressure turbine. An annular
combustor converts fuel and compressor discharge air into energy to provide engine
thrust part through primary exhaust and to drive the turbines. The accessory drive system
extracts energy from the high pressure rotor to drive the engine accessories and the
engine mounted aircraft accessories. Reverse thrust for braking the aircraft after landing is
supplied by an integrated system which acts on the fan discharge airflow.
B. 
Nacelle
 
The cowls enclose the periphery of the engine so as to form the engine nacelle. Each
engine is housed in a nacelle suspended from a pylon attached to the wing lower surface.
The nacelle consists of the demountable powerplant, the fan cowls and the thrust reverser
cowls.
 
The nacelle installation is designed to provide cooling and ventilation air for engine
accessories mounted along the fan and core casing. The nacelle provides:
-  protection for the engine and the accessories
-  airflow around the engine during its operation
-  lighting protection
-  HIRF and EMI attenuation.

## Page 135

A. 
Engine
 
The engine is a two spool, axial flow, high bypass ratio turbofan powerplant for subsonic
service. The main modules of the engine are:
-  low pressure compressor (fan and booster) assembly
-  LP compressor/intermediate case
-  No. 4 bearing and combustion section
-  high pressure compressor
-  HP turbine section
-  LP turbine section
-  accessory drives (gear box).
 
The four stage Low Pressure Compressor (LPC) is driven by a five stage Low Pressure
Turbine (LPT) and the ten stage High Pressure Compressor (HPC) by a two stage High
Pressure Turbine (HPT). The HPT also drives a gearbox which, in turn drives the engines
and aircraft mounted accessories. The two shafts are supported by five main bearings.
 
The V2500 incorporates a Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) which governs all
engine functions, including power management. Reverse thrust for braking the aircraft after
landing is supplied by an integrated system which acts on the fan discharge airflow.
B. 
Nacelle
 
The cowls enclose the periphery of the engine so as to form the engine nacelle. Each
engine is housed in a nacelle suspended from a pylon attached below the wing.
 
The nacelle installation is designed to provide cooling and ventilation air for engine
accessories mounted along the fan and core casing. The nacelle provides:
-  protection for the engine and the accessories
-  airflow around the engine during its operation
-  lighting protection
-  HIRF and EMI attenuation.

Leveling, Symmetry and Alignment
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Leveling, Symmetry and Alignment
1.
Quick Leveling
There are three alternative procedures to level the aircraft:
-  Quick leveling procedure with Air Data/Inertial Reference Unit (ADIRU).
-  Quick leveling procedure with a spirit level in the passenger compartment.
-  Quick leveling procedure with a spirit level in the FWD cargo compartment.
2.
Precise Leveling
For precise leveling, it is necessary to install sighting rods in the receptacles located under the
fuselage (points 11 and 12 for longitudinal leveling) and under the wings (points 2LH and 2RH
for lateral leveling) and use a sighting tube. With the aircraft on jacks, adjust the jacks until the
reference marks on the sighting rods are aligned in the sighting plane (aircraft level).
3.
Symmetry and Alignment Check
Possible deformation of the aircraft is measured by photogrammetry.

Jacking
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Jacking for Maintenance
1.
Aircraft Jacking Points for Maintenance
A. 
General
(1)
The A321 can be jacked:
-  At not more than 69 000 kg (152 119 lb),
-  Within the limits of the permissible wind speed when the aircraft is not in a closed
environment.
B. 
Primary Jacking Points
(1)
The aircraft is provided with three primary jacking points:
-  One located under the forward fuselage (FR8),
-  Two located under the wings (one under each wing, located at the intersection of
RIB9 and the datum of the rear spar).
(2)
Three jack adapters are used as intermediary parts between the aircraft and the jacks:
-  One male spherical jack adapter of 19 mm (0.75 in) radius, forming part of the
aircraft structure (FR8),
-  Two wing jack pads (one attached to each wing at RIB9 with 2 bolts) for the
location of the jack adaptor.
Wing jack pads are ground equipment.
C. 
Auxiliary Jacking Points (Safety Stay)
(1)
When the aircraft is on jacks, it is recommended that a safety stay be placed under
the fuselage, between FR73 and FR74, to prevent tail tipping caused by accidental
displacement of the center of gravity.
(2)
The safety stay must not be used to lift the aircraft.
(3)
A male spherical ball pad with a 19 mm (0.75 in) radius, forming part of the aircraft
structure, is provided for using the safety stay.
2.
Jacks and Safety Stay
A. 
Jack Design
(1)
The maximum permitted loads given in the table in FIGURE 2-14-0-991-038-A are the
maximum loads applicable on jack fittings.



---

<a name="page-154"></a>
## Page 154

(2)
In the fully retracted position (jack stroke at minimum), the height of the jack is such
that the jack may be placed beneath the aircraft in the most adverse conditions,
namely, tires deflated and shock absorbers depressurized. In addition, there must be a
clearance of approximately 50 mm (1.97 in) between the aircraft jacking point and the
jack upper end.
(3)
The lifting jack stroke enables the aircraft to be jacked up so that the fuselage
longitudinal datum line (aircraft center line) is parallel to the ground, with a clearance
of 100 mm (3.94 in) between the main landing gear wheels and the ground. This
enables the landing gear extension/retraction tests to be performed.
3.
Shoring Cradles
 
When it is necessary to support the aircraft in order to relieve the loads on the structure to do
modifications or major work, shoring cradles shall be placed under each wing and the fuselage
as necessary.
 
NOTE :
The aircraft must not be lifted or supported by the wings or fuselage alone without
adequate support of the other.

Jacking of the Landing Gear
1.
General
 
Landing gear jacking will be required to lift the landing gear wheels off the ground.
 
NOTE :
You can lift the aircraft at Maximum Ramp Weight (MRW).
 
NOTE :
The load at each jacking position is the load required to give a 25.4 mm (1 in)
clearance between the ground and the tire.
 
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200
2.
Main Gear Jacking
 
The main gears are normally jacked up by placing a jack directly under the ball pad.
 
The ball spherical radius is 19 mm (0.75 in).
 
It is also possible to jack the main gear using a cantilever jack.
 
The reactions at each of the jacking points are shown in the table, see FIGURE 2-14-0-991-061-

General Information
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
General Information
1.
This section provides aircraft turning capability and maneuvering characteristics.
 
For ease of presentation, this data has been determined from the theoretical limits imposed by
the geometry of the aircraft, and where noted, provides for a normal allowance for tire slippage.
As such, it reflects the turning capability of the aircraft in favorable operating circumstances. This
data should only be used as a guideline for the method of determination of such parameters and
for the maneuvering characteristics of this aircraft type.
 
In ground operating mode, varying airline practices may demand that more conservative turning
procedures be adopted to avoid excessive tire wear and reduce possible maintenance problems.
Airline operating techniques will vary in the level of performance, over a wide range of operating
circumstances throughout the world. Variations from standard aircraft operating patterns may
be necessary to satisfy physical constraints within the maneuvering area, such as adverse
grades, limited area or a high risk of jet blast damage. For these reasons, ground maneuvering
requirements should be coordinated with the airlines in question prior to layout planning.

**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Minimum Line-Up Distance Corrections
1.
The ground maneuvers were performed using asymmetric thrust and differential braking only to
initiate the turn.
TODA: Take-Off Distance Available
ASDA: Acceleration-Stop Distance Available
2.
90° Turn on Runway Entry
This section gives the minimum line-up distance correction for a 90° turn on runway entry.
This maneuver consists in a 90° turn at minimum turn radius. It starts with the edge of the MLG
at a distance of 3 m (10 ft) from the taxiway edge, and finishes with the aircraft aligned on the
centerline of the runway, see FIGURE 4-7-0-991-020-A.
During the turn, all the clearances must meet the minimum value of 3 m (10 ft) for this category
of aircraft as recommended in ICAO Annex 14.
3.
180° Turn on Runway Turn Pad
This section gives the minimum line-up distance correction for a 180° turn on the runway turn
pad.
This maneuver consists in a 180° turn at minimum turn radius on a runway turn pad with
standard ICAO geometry.
It starts with the edge of the MLG at a distance of 3 m (10 ft) from the pavement edge, and it
finishes with the aircraft aligned on the centerline of the runway, see FIGURE 4-7-0-991-021-A.
During the turn, all the clearances must meet the minimum value of 3 m (10 ft) for this category
of aircraft as recommended in ICAO Annex 14.
4.
180° Turn on Runway Width
This section gives the minimum line-up distance correction for a 180° turn on the runway width.
For this maneuver, the pavement width is considered to be the runway width, which is a frozen
parameter (30 m (100 ft), 45 m (150 ft) and 60 m (200 ft)).
As per the standard operating procedures for the ”180° turn on runway” (described in the Flight
Crew Operating Manual), the aircraft is initially angled with respect to the runway centerline
when starting the 180° turn, see FIGURE 4-7-0-991-022-A.
The value of this angle depends on the aircraft type and is mentioned in the FCOM.
During the turn, all the clearances must meet the minimum value of 3 m (10 ft) for this category
of aircraft as recommended in ICAO Annex 14.

B. 
The grounding (earthing) studs are used to connect the aircraft to an approved ground
(earth) connection on the ramp or in the hangar for:
-  Refuel/defuel operations,
-  Maintenance operations,
-  Bad weather conditions.
 
NOTE :
In all other conditions, the electrostatic discharge through the tire is sufficient.
If the aircraft is on jacks for retraction and extension checks or for the removal/
installation of the landing gear, the grounding (earthing) alternative points (if
installed) are:
-  In the hole on the avionics-compartment lateral right door-frame (on FR14),
-  On the engine nacelles,
-  Adjacent to the high-pressure connector,
-  On the wing upper surfaces.

Ground Pneumatic Power Requirements
1.
General
This section describes the required performance for the ground equipment to maintain the cabin
temperature at 27 °C (80.6 °F) for the cooling or 21 °C (69.8 °F) for heating cases after boarding
(Section 5.7 - steady state), and provides the time needed to cool down or heat up the aircraft
cabin to the required temperature (Section 5.6 - dynamic cases with aircraft empty).

A. 
The air flow rates and temperature requirements for the GSE, provided in Sections 5.6 and
5.7, are given at A/C ground connection.
NOTE :
The cooling capacity of the equipment (kW) is only indicative and is not sufficient
by itself to ensure the performance (outlet temperature and flow rate combinations
are the requirements needed for ground power). An example of cooling capacity
calculation is given in Section 5.7.
 
NOTE :
The maximum air flow is driven by pressure limitation at the ground connection.
B. 
For temperatures at ground connection below 2 °C (35.6 °F) (Subfreezing), the ground
equipment shall be compliant with the Airbus document ”Subfreezing PCA Carts -
Compliance Document for Suppliers” (contact Airbus to obtain this document) defining all
the requirements with which Subfreezing Pre-Conditioning Air equipment must comply
to allow its use on Airbus aircraft. These requirements are in addition to the functional
specifications included in the IATA AHM997.

Preconditioned Airflow Requirements
1.
This section provides the preconditioned airflow rate and temperature needed to maintain the
cabin temperature at 27 °C (80.6 °F) for the cooling or 21 °C (69.8 °F) for the heating cases.
 
These settings are not intended to be used for operation (they are not a substitute for the
settings given in the AMM). They are based on theoretical simulations and give the picture of a
real steady state.
The purpose of the air conditioning (cooling) operation (described in the AMM) is to maintain the
cabin temperature below 27 °C (80.6 °F) during boarding (therefore it is not a steady state).

**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Ground Towing Requirements
1.
This section gives information on aircraft towing.
This aircraft is designed with means for standard or towbarless towing. Information/procedures
can be found for both in AMM 09.
Status on towbarless towing equipment qualification can be found in ISI 09.11.00001.
NOTE :
The NLG steering deactivation pin has the same design for all Airbus programs.
 
One towbar fitting is installed at the front of the leg.
The main landing gears have attachment points for towing or debogging (for details, refer ARM
07).
 
This section shows the chart to determine the drawbar pull and tow tractor mass requirements
as a function of the following physical characteristics:
-  Aircraft weight,
-  Number of engines at idle,
-  Slope.
The chart is based on the engine type with the highest idle thrust level.
2.
Towbar design guidelines
 
The aircraft towbar shall comply with the following standards:
-  ISO 8267-1, ”Aircraft - Towbar Attachment Fitting - Interface Requirements - Part 1: Main
Line Aircraft",
-  SAE AS 1614, ”Main Line Aircraft Towbar Attach Fitting Interface",
-  SAE ARP 1915, ”Aircraft Towbar",
-  ISO 9667, ”Aircraft Ground Support Equipment - Towbar - Connection to Aircraft and
Tractor",
-  EN 12312-7, ”Aircraft Ground Support Equipment - Specific Requirements - Part 7: Aircraft
Movement Equipment",
-  IATA Airport Handling Manual AHM 958, ”Functional Specification for an Aircraft Towbar".
 
A standard type towbar is required which should be equipped with a damping system (to protect
the nose gear against jerks) and with towing shear pins:
-  A traction shear pin calibrated at 9 425 daN (21 188 lbf),
-  A torsion pin calibrated at 826 m.daN (6 092 lbf.ft).

General
This section provides the estimated engine exhaust efflux velocities and temperatures contours
for Ground Idle, Breakaway and Maximum Take-Off (MTO) conditions.
**ON A/C A321neo
2.
General
This section provides the estimated engine exhaust velocity and temperature contours for MTO,
Breakaway 12% MTO, Breakaway 24% MTO and Ground Idle conditions for the CFM LEAP-1A
and PW 1100G engines.
 
The MTO data are presented at the maximum thrust rating. The Breakaway data are presented
at a rating that corresponds to the minimum thrust level necessary to start the movement of the
A/C from a static position at its maximum ramp weight. Breakaway thrust corresponds to 12%
MTO if applied on both engines and 24% MTO when applied on a single engine (Idle thrust on
the other engine).
 
The Idle data, provided by the engine manufacturer, are calculated for operational conditions
ISA +15K (+15°C), Sea Level, Static and no headwind. In the charts, the longitudinal distances
are measured from the inboard engine core-nozzle exit section. The lateral distances are
measured from the aircraft fuselage centerline.
 
The effects of on-wing installation are not taken into account. The effects of ground proximity
are not taken into account for PW 1100G engines, but they are taken into account for the CFM
LEAP-1A engines.
 
The velocity contours are presented at 50 ft/s (15 m/s), 100 ft/s (30 m/s) and 150 ft/s (46 m/s).

The temperature contours are shown at 313K (+40°C), 323K (+50°C) and 333K (+60°C).
The velocity and temperature contours do not take into account possible variations affecting
performance, such as ambient temperature, field elevation or failure cases leading to an
abnormal bleed configuration. To evaluate the impact of these specific variables on the exhaust
contours, a specific study of the airport where the aircraft is intended to operate should be
carried out.

PAVEMENT DATA
7-1-0
General Information
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
General Information
1.
A brief description of the pavement charts that follow will help in airport planning.
 
To aid in the interpolation between the discrete values shown, each aircraft configuration is
shown with a minimum range of five loads on the Main Landing Gear (MLG).
 
All curves on the charts represent data at a constant specified tire pressure with:
-  The aircraft loaded to the Maximum Ramp Weight (MRW),
-  The CG at its maximum permissible aft position.
 
Pavement requirements for commercial aircraft are derived from the static analysis of loads
imposed on the MLG struts.
 
Landing Gear Footprint:
Section 07-02-00 presents basic data on the landing gear footprint configuration, MRW and tire
sizes and pressures.
 
Maximum Pavement Loads:
Section 07-03-00 shows maximum vertical and horizontal pavement loads for certain critical
conditions at the tire-ground interfaces.
 
Landing Gear Loading on Pavement:
The curves related to the landing gear loading on pavement are not given in section 07-04-00.
Because the relationship between the aircraft weight, the center of gravity and the landing gear
loading on the pavement is not strictly linear, it cannot be shown in chart format. But you can
find in section 07-03-00 the maximum vertical and horizontal pavement loads for some critical
conditions at the tire/ground interfaces for all the operational weight variants of the aircraft.
For questions that are related to landing gear loading on pavement, contact Airbus.
 
Flexible Pavement Requirements - US Army Corps of Engineers Design Method:



---

<a name="page-376"></a>
## Page 376

The flexible pavement requirements curves as per U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Design
Method are not given in section 07-05-00 since the related data is available through free
software.
Sections 07-02-00 and 07-03-00 give all the inputs data required for the use of such software.
For questions that are related to the flexible pavement requirements, contact Airbus.
 
Flexible Pavement Requirements - LCN Conversion Method:
The Load Classification Number (LCN) curves are not given in section 07-06-00 since the LCN
system for reporting pavement strength is old and are replaced by the ICAO recommended
ACN/PCN system in 1983 and ACR/PCR system in 2020.
For questions that are related to the LCN system, contact Airbus.
 
Rigid Pavement Requirements - PCA (Portland Cement Association) Design Method:
The rigid pavement requirements curves as per as Portland Cement Association Design Method
are not given in section 07-07-00 since the related data is available through free software.
Sections 07-02-00 and 07-03-00 give all the inputs data required for the use of such software.
For questions that are related to the rigid pavement requirements, contact Airbus.
 
Rigid Pavement Requirements - LCN Conversion:
The Load Classification Number (LCN) curves are not given in section 07-08-00 since the LCN
system for reporting pavement strength is old and are replaced by the ICAO recommended
ACN/PCN system in 1983 and ACR/PCR system in 2020.
For questions that are related to the LCN system, contact Airbus.
 
ACN/PCN Reporting System:
Section 07-09-00 gives ACN data prepared according to the ACN/PCN system as referenced in
ICAO Annex 14, ”Aerodromes”, Volume 1 ”Aerodrome Design and Operations”.
Eighth Edition July 2018, incorporating Amendments 1 to 14 and ICAO doc 9157, "Aerodrome
Design Manual", part 3 "Pavements" Second Edition 1983.
The ACN/PCN system is applicable until November 2024.
ACN is the Aircraft Classification Number and PCN is the related Pavement Classification
Number.
An aircraft with an ACN less than or equal to the PCN can operate without restriction on the
pavement.
Numerically the ACN is two times the derived single-wheel load expressed in thousands of
kilograms.
The derived single-wheel load is calculated as the load on a single tire inflated to 1.25 MPa (181
psi) that can have the same pavement requirements as the aircraft.
Computationally the ACN/PCN system uses PCA program PDILB for rigid pavements and S-77-
1 for flexible pavements to calculate ACN values.
 
The airport authority must select the method of pavement analysis.
The results of their analysis should be reported using the following format:

Section 07-09-00 shows the aircraft ACN values.
 
For flexible pavements, the four subgrade categories (CBR) are:
A. High Strength
CBR 15
B. Medium Strength
CBR 10
C. Low Strength
CBR 6
D. Ultra Low Strength
CBR 3
 
 
For rigid pavements, the four subgrade categories (k) are:
A. High Strength
k = 150 MN/m³ (550 pci)
B. Medium Strength
k = 80 MN/m³ (300 pci)
C. Low Strength
k = 40 MN/m³ (150 pci)
D. Ultra Low Strength
k = 20 MN/m³ (75 pci)
 
ACR/PCR Reporting System:
Section 07-10-00 gives ACR data prepared according to the ACR/PCR system as referenced in
ICAO Annex 14, "Aerodromes", Volume 1 "Aerodrome Design and Operations".
Eight Edition July 2018, incorporating Amendments 1 to 15 and ICAO doc 9157, "Aerodrome
Design Manual", part 3 "Pavements" Third Edition 2021.
The ACR/PCR system is effective from November 2020 and will be applicable in November
2024.
ACR is the Aircraft Classification Rating and PCR is the related Pavement Classification Rating.
An aircraft with an ACR less than or equal to the PCR can operate without restriction on the
pavement.
Numerically the ACR is two times the derived single-wheel load expressed in hundreds of
kilograms.
The derived single-wheel load is calculated as the load on a single tire inflated to 1.50 Mpa (218
psi) that can have the same pavement requirements as the aircraft.

Computationally the ACR/PCR system relies on the Linear Elastic Analysis (LEA). The ACR are
computed with the official ICAO-ACR software.
States can start their own methods for PCR determination, which agree with the overall
parameters of the ACR/PCR method.
The results of their analysis should be reported with the following format:

D – Ultra Low
Z – Low Pressure Limited to 0.5

Section 07-10-00 shows the aircraft ACR value.
For flexible and rigid pavement, the four subgrade categories are defined based on the subgrade
modulus of elasticity (E):
A. High Strength
E = 200 Mpa (29 008 psi)
B. Medium Strength
E = 120 Mpa (17 405 psi)
C. Low Strength
E = 80 Mpa (11 603 psi)
D. Ultra Low Strength
E = 50 Mpa (7 252 psi)

Landing Gear Loading on Pavement
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Landing Gear Loading on Pavement
1. 
The curves related to the landing gear loading on pavement are not given in section 07-04-00.
Because the relationship between the aircraft weight, the center of gravity and the landing gear
loading on the pavement is not strictly linear, it cannot be shown in chart format. But you can
find in section 07-03-00 the maximum vertical and horizontal pavement loads for some critical
conditions at the tire/ground interfaces for all the operational weight variants of the aircraft.
For questions that are related to landing gear loading on pavement, contact Airbus.

1. 
The flexible pavement requirements curves as per as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Design
Method are not given in section 07-05-00 since the related data is available through free
software.
Sections 07-02-00 and 07-03-00 give all the inputs data required for the use of such software.
NOTE :
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Design Method for flexible pavements is being
gradually superseded by mechanistic-empirical design methods mostly relying on
Linear Elastic Analysis (LEA). The number of parameters considered by such methods
is not applicable for a chart format and the use of dedicated pavement-design software
is necessary.

ACN/PCN Reporting System - Flexible and Rigid Pavements
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
Aircraft Classification Number - Flexible and Rigid Pavements
1.
This section gives data about the Aircraft Classification Number (ACN) for an aircraft gross
weight in relation with standard subgrade strength values for flexible and rigid pavement.
To find the ACN of an aircraft on flexible and rigid pavement, you must know the aircraft gross
weight and the subgrade strength.
 
NOTE :
An aircraft with an ACN equal to or less than the reported PCN can operate on that
pavement, subject to any limitation on the tire pressure.
(Ref: ICAO Aerodrome Design Manual, Part 3, Chapter 1, Second Edition 1983).

Aircraft Classification Number - ACN table
The tables in FIGURE 7-9-0-991-019-A, FIGURE 7-9-0-991-022-A and FIGURE 7-9-0-991-025-
A give ACN data in tabular format for all the operational weight variants.
As an approximation, use a linear interpolation in order to get the ACN at the required operating
weight using the following equation:
-  ACN = ACN min + (ACN max - ACN min) x (Operating weight - 47 000 kg)/(MRW - 47 000
kg)
Please note that the interpolation error may reach 5% to 10%.
As an approximation, use a linear interpolation in order to get the aircraft weight at the pavement
PCN using the following equation:
-  Operating weight = 47 000 kg + (MRW - 47 000 kg) x (PCN - ACN min)/(ACN max - ACN
min)
Please note that the interpolation error may reach up to 5%.
With ACN max = ACN calculated at the MRW in the table and with ACN min = ACN calculated at
47 000 kg.
 
For questions or specific calculation regarding ACN/PCN Reporting System, contact Airbus.

Please note that the interpolation error may reach 5% to 10%.
As an approximation, use a linear interpolation in order to get the aircraft weight at the pavement

ACR/PCR Reporting System - Flexible And Rigid Pavements
**ON A/C A321-100 A321-200 A321neo
ACR/PCR Reporting System - Flexible and Rigid Pavements
1.
The ACR/PCR system has been developed by the ICAO to overcome the deficiencies of the
ACN/PCN system. Significant advances in pavement design methods had occurred since its
development in the late 1970s early 1980s, leading to inconsistencies with the pavement-
strength-rating system.
The ACR/PCR system entails new procedures for the determination of both the ACR and the
PCR that are consistent with the current pavement design procedures. This allows to capture
the effects of the improved characteristics of new pavement materials as well as modern landing
gear configurations, thus leading to an improved accuracy.
This section gives data about the Aircraft Classification Rating (ACR) for the maximum ramp
weight in relation with standard subgrade strength values for flexible and rigid pavement.
To determine the ACR at other aircraft gross weight, use the official ICAO-ACR software.
NOTE :
An aircraft with an ACR equal to or less than the reported PCR can operate on that
pavement, subject to any limitation on the tire pressure. (Ref: ICAO Aerodrome Design
Manual, Part 3, Third Edition 2020).
2.
Aircraft Classification Rating - ACR Table
The tables in FIGURE 7-10-0-991-001-A, FIGURE 7-10-0-991-002-A, FIGURE 7-10-0-991-011-
A and FIGURE 7-10-0-991-012-A give ACR data in tabular format for all the operational weight
variants of the aircraft.
For questions or specific calculation related to ACR/PCR Reporting System, contact Airbus.
